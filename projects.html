      <strong>Role:</strong> Programmer & Technical Designer •
      <strong>Scope:</strong> Solo development (technical)
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of a university assignment, I developed a complete 2D platformer prototype, handling the full
      technical production pipeline. I implemented gameplay systems, player controls, collisions, and interactions,
      and designed levels with a focus on pacing, readability, and difficulty progression.
    </p>

    <p>
      All programming, level design, and overall technical setup were completed by me.
      The pixel art and music were created by external artists and are credited accordingly.
