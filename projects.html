    <h3>2D Platformer (University Project)</h3>

    <p class="project-meta">
      <strong>Role:</strong> Programmer & Technical Designer •
      <strong>Scope:</strong> Solo development (technical)
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of a university assignment, I developed a complete 2D platformer prototype, handling the full
      technical production pipeline. I implemented gameplay systems, player controls, collisions, and interactions,
      and designed levels with a focus on pacing, readability, and difficulty progression.
    </p>

    <p>
      All programming, level design, and overall technical setup were completed by me.
      The pixel art and music were created by external artists and are credited accordingly.

<h3>Blender Lighting & Rendering Study</h3>

  <p>
    I began experimenting with Blender approximately three years ago during my first introductory course.
    From that initial experience, I realized that 3D creation was a field I wanted to pursue further.
  </p>

  <p>
    This scene is one of my early Blender projects and was created as a lighting and rendering study.
    The focus was on experimenting with light placement, material response, and overall scene presentation,
    aiming to achieve a clear and visually balanced result.

  <h3>Unmasked — Global Game Jam Project</h3>
  <p class="project-subtitle">48-hour Global Game Jam · 3D Artist</p>

  <p>
    Built during a 48-hour global game jam with a small team. I was responsible
    for the full 3D art pipeline, including low-poly asset creation, texturing,
    and scene assembly. I also produced the audio track used in the final level.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project focused on rapid iteration, visual clarity, and performance,
    while maintaining a cohesive artistic direction under tight time constraints.
