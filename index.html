      <p>
       <p>
  I studied in the <strong>Department of Performing and Digital Arts</strong>, with a focus on the artistic
  perspective of integrating digital elements into contemporary art practices. The program was
  interdisciplinary in nature and emphasized both creative exploration and technical understanding.
</p>

<p>
  My studies covered a broad range of subjects, including <strong>game development</strong>,
  <strong>basic programming</strong>, <strong>3D modeling</strong>, and <strong>sound design</strong>.
  I also completed coursework on <strong>interactive installations</strong>, focusing on their conceptual
  development and practical implementation. I also had an introductory course on 3D animation.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, the curriculum included extensive training in <strong>video editing</strong>,
  <strong>cinema</strong>, <strong>scenario development</strong>, and <strong>character building</strong>,
  which strengthened my skills in visual storytelling and narrative design across digital media.

    <p>
      This position marks my first professional experience as a 3D artist.
      I am currently working as a <strong>3D Artist Intern</strong> at the
      <strong>Foundation of the Hellenic World</strong>, where I contribute to
      the creation of <strong>game-ready 3D assets</strong> for use in the
      <strong>Unity game engine</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My responsibilities include modeling, texturing, and optimizing assets
      to meet real-time performance requirements, while following established
      production pipelines and technical constraints. Through this role, I am
      gaining hands-on experience with professional workflows and collaborative

    </p>

    <p>
      As part of a university assignment, I developed a complete 2D platformer prototype, handling the full
      technical production pipeline. I implemented gameplay systems, player controls, collisions, and interactions,
      and designed levels with a focus on pacing, readability, and difficulty progression.
    </p>

    <p>
      All programming, level design, and overall technical setup were completed by me.
      The pixel art and music were created by external artists and are credited accordingly.

  <p>
    I began experimenting with Blender approximately three years ago during my first introductory course.
    From that initial experience, I realized that 3D creation was a field I wanted to pursue further.

  <p>
    This scene is one of my early Blender projects and was created as a lighting and rendering study.
    The focus was on experimenting with light placement, material response, and overall scene presentation,
    aiming to achieve a clear and visually balanced result.

      <h2>Historical Musket — Game-Ready Asset</h2>
      <p class="project-subtitle">Internship Project · Foundation of the Hellenic World</p>

      <p>
        This project is a historically accurate musket from the Greek War of Independence (1821), created as part of my internship at the Foundation of the Hellenic World. The asset was developed using a full high-to-low poly workflow, beginning with a highly detailed high-poly model to capture fine surface details and authentic proportions.

I followed a complete multi-UV texturing pipeline and baked all texture maps to an optimized low-poly version of the asset, ensuring efficient performance in real-time environments. The final model was reduced to approximately 3,000 triangles and prepared for seamless integration into the Unity game engine, balancing visual fidelity with technical constraints suitable for gameplay use.

      <h2>Flintlock Pistol — Game-Ready Asset</h2>
      <p class="project-subtitle">Internship Project · Foundation of the Hellenic World</p>

      <p>
        Using the same high-to-low poly workflow as the musket project, I created a fully game-ready flintlock pistol optimized for real-time use. The asset was developed through a complete baking pipeline, producing clean and efficient texture maps suitable for in-engine implementation.

Texturing was based on photo-sourced reference material, which I refined through additional texture painting to improve visual clarity and consistency at game resolution. This process focused on minimizing low-resolution artifacts, cleaning up noisy surface areas, and enhancing engraved details to ensure strong readability and a polished presentation in-engine.
