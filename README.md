# 👾 Stamatina Spyratou — Portfolio

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

This is my personal portfolio, where I showcase my work in **3D art**, **game-ready assets**, and **environment creation**. Most of the projects here are built with games in mind — real-time constraints, performance awareness, and clean workflows.

---

## 🧩 What you’ll find here

- 🎮 **Game-ready 3D assets**  
  Created mainly in Blender, using high-to-low poly workflows and baked textures.

- 🛠 **Technical awareness**  
  Assets prepared for engines like Unity, with attention to optimization and pipeline compatibility.

- ⏱ **Game jam & internship projects**  
  Including work produced under tight deadlines and professional constraints.

## 🧠 How I like to work

I enjoy the challenge of turning detailed ideas into practical assets that actually work in-engine.  
I’m especially interested in the point where **art meets technical limitations** — balancing visual quality with performance.

Alongside my art practice, I’m gradually learning more about the technical side of game development (including basic coding) to better understand the full production pipeline and collaborate more effectively in team environments.

## 🧪 Tools I use

- Blender  
- Unity  
- Substance Painter  
- Photoshop / GIMP / Krita  
- A growing amount of Git (learning, breaking things, fixing them)

---

## 🚧 Status

This portfolio is **actively evolving**.  
I update it as I learn, experiment, and complete new projects — so expect changes.
